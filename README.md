# Move by word

I'm very used to emacs-style bindings for char- and word-based navigation in those applications that do not support vim mode or are awkward to use vim mode with. Obsidian, like many other apps, has partial support for these; basically shortcuts with `control` key work and those with `option` do not.

So I wrote this simple plugin to make word-based navigation configurable. The plugin adds the following commands:

- Move word forward
- Move word backward
- Delete word forward

That's basically all of it.
